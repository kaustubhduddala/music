# music
this is my music production learning journey documented

# how to read file names
the last number is which hour of the song it is, while everything in front is which song is it

# example 

284.wav = song 28, after 4 hours

1.wav = song 0, 1 hour in

428853.wav = song 42885, 3 hours in

so far no song has taken over 9 hours, but it it comes to that i'll have a system in place for that too

# why the weird naming?
I'm not naming songs atm since I'm not good enough for that but we'll get there!
